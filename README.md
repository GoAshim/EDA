# EDA

Here I wrote python programs to perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) for the following scenarios -

* Analyse NBA players career statistics from the dataset we collected by web scraping [GitHub Link of the code](https://www.basketball-reference.com/leagues/NBA_2022_totals.html). 

* Analyze obesity, diabetes, and physical inactivity prevalence for adults in the United States based on the public dataset available on the subject matter.
 
* Analyze sales data - scenario 1.

* Analyze sales data - scenario 2.
