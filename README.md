# EDA

Here I wrote python programs to perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) for the following scenarios -

* Analyse NBA players career statistics from the dataset we collected by web scraping [GitHub Link](https://github.com/GoAshim/WebScraping/blob/27939865ea33f8c5c1d43bd1941662de9908b8a3/Web_Scraping_3_NBA_Player_Stats_for_Entire_Career.ipynb) of the code. 

* Analyze obesity, diabetes, and physical inactivity prevalence for adults in the United States based on the public dataset available on the subject matter.
 
* Analyze sales data - scenario 1.

* Analyze sales data - scenario 2.
