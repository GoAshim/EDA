We are going to start with the page containing the 2021-22 NBA Player Stats from Basketball Reference site (link [here](https://www.basketball-reference.com/leagues/NBA_2022_totals.html)). Instead of scraping the statistics of only 2021-22 season (as we did on our first exercise), we are going to find each player played in 2021-22 season from the table in the link mentioned above, then go to the page of each individual player and scrap the statistics of their entire career.\n",

We are going to identify the table, find out the URL link of every player from that table, then for each player we will go to their respective URL to scrap relevant data and load that on a dataframe. At the end the dataframe will have the the entire career statistics of all NBA Players played in 2021-22 season."
